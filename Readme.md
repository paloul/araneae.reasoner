### Build Process 
This project has been set up to build with the Clion IDE. Take a look at two screenshots under  
Docs/Screenshots to see how to configure builds with Clion. Ninja and Cmake are dependencies.  
The project started development on a Windows10 machine within the WSL2 environment. The Clion IDE  
should be configured to do the same. Take a look at the WSL-Toolchain.png screenshot under  
/Docs/Screenshots to see how to configure WSL2 with Clion IDE.
